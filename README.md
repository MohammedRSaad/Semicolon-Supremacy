# Semicolon-Supremacy
    Paper consumption is one of the main reasons for forestation. In the past years, many uses of paper have been changed to electronic formats such as pdf and Docx. Schools consume large amounts of paper each year which can be replaced by electronic files. The purpose of this project is to handle one of the paper consumption causes: tacking attendance. While each day the attendance of school students is taken more than one-time using paper, taking it on paper isnâ€™t important because it is put into spreadsheets later. The Attendance Manager program will help class presidents to take the attendance and then send it to school management in CSV format. In addition, it provides an easy way to create new classes; add, remove, and transfer students between classes; and show class attendance sheets when needed.
